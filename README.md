# My-adventure-into-Machine Learning

What started to be a notepad for understanding Markov Chains I will continue to document my process of learning popular
Machine Learning Algorithms.

## Markov Chain Monte Carlo with Bayesian Inference

Attached python file is my notebook with heavily commented code 
on how to use Markov Chain Monte Carlo to update one's belief after seeing particular evidence.
